# Examples

In order to showcase the versatility and flexibility of MLGarden, we have created three example configuration files tailored for use with the popular Ames Housing dataset. This dataset is widely recognized in the machine learning community for its comprehensive information on residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

For a detailed description of the dataset and access to the data itself, you can visitÂ [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashanknecrothapa/ames-housing-dataset).

The three configuration files available in the example folder are as follows:

`1_ames_housing_hp_baseline.json`  : presents a baseline solution for the dataset

`2_ames_housing_hp_tuning.json` : conducts hyperparameter tuning using Optuna

`3_ames_housing_hp_tuned.json`  : trains a model using the optimized hyperparameters

By utilizing these example configuration files with the Ames Housing dataset, users can actively engage with MLGarden, gaining practical experience and insight into how to effectively utilize its features for constructing and training machine learning models.
