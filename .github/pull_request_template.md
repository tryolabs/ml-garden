# Secondary changes

<!-- If your PR includes other small changes like bugfixes and documentation
improvements, mention them here.  If not, feel free to delete this section
or leave it blank. -->

# Outcome/Conclusion

<!-- If your PR includes experiments or other forms of research, briefly
comment what the results of the experiment means for the future.

Example, if the PR is about trying out a new data augmentation technique:

"Using this form of data augmentation improved results for Logo CNN and
Vachetta CNN, but not the other models. In particular, metrics got much worse
for Coated Canvas."

metrics significantly, and you want to showcase the change in metrics,
you can add a section here mentioning which model the metrics are
related to.
